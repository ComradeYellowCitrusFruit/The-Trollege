# The Trollege
This very small program has the capability to nuke your computer. It spam starts cmd, infinitly forks itself, allocates as much memory as possible, and makes a bunch of text files that consume your hard drive. The very first thing it does is hide the console, so you have to use task manager to stop it. It may not delete system32, yet, but it does fuck up your computer, albeit reversibly. For the moment this is windows only.
